# TPE-wave-project

Written as a High School Junior at the end of 2011: 

Code for a graphical wave simulator that demonstrates the findings of my "TPE" project for the French Baccalaureate. We received perfect marks and highest honest for our work.
The goal of our project was to demonstrate the affects of oceanic topography on the wave length and amplitude of waves in different environements.

This was also one of the first programs I ever wrote using classes.

Written for Python 2.6.6
Uses PyGame for graphics.
